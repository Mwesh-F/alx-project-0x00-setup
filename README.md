# 🏠 Next.js Airbnb Clone – Project 0x00

This project is a simplified **Airbnb-like web application** built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is designed as a learning exercise to help you grasp the **fundamentals of modern frontend web development**, including component-based architecture, routing, and responsive design.

## 🚀 Project Description

This application mimics core features of Airbnb’s UI such as:

- Property listings with images and ratings
- Interactive components
- Responsive layouts

The goal is to understand how to build scalable, well-structured applications using modern tools and best practices.

## 🧠 Best Practices

### 🔹 Project Structure
- Components are in a dedicated `components/` directory
- TypeScript interfaces live in a centralized `interfaces/` directory
- Pages follow Next.js conventions in the `pages/` directory

### 🔹 Component Design
- All components are typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Props are used for flexibility and reuse
- Each component has a single responsibility

### 🔹 Code Quality
- ESLint ensures clean, consistent code
- TypeScript enforces type safety
- Arrow functions are used consistently

### 🔹 Styling
- Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first, responsive design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Mobile-first design approach

### 🔹 Performance
- Next.js `<Image />` component is used for optimized images
- Code splitting is automatic with Next.js
- No unnecessary dependencies

## ✍️ Note on Learning

⚠️ **Note:**  
While copying and pasting code may seem fast, it can hinder real learning. To get the most out of this experience:

- Read and understand each instruction carefully
- Type the code yourself to grasp the logic and structure
- Test and experiment to see how things work in practice

> Hands-on practice leads to deeper understanding and long-term retention. Keep coding and stay curious!
